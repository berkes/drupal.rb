# Site - Drupal has a multisite concept. One codebase can deliver more then one site.
#   Drupal.rb thinks this is usefull *only* for staging. Running two different
#   websites (dog-collection and cat-collecition) means makeing two new Projects. See Project class.
#   a site has one database. 
#   a site has many available modules (core + addons).
#   trough the database (where module statii are recorded, ugh) these modules 
#   are enabled and disabled. 
#   most site-details, however, are found in a file settings.php in a specially named directory. 
#   more on this feature: http://drupal.org/getting-started/6/install/multi-site
