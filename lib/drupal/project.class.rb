# Project - Not Drupal-specific. A project consists of a core, with one or many sites. 
#  A project is located somewhere on disk and is a git working directory. 
#  A project has DTAP, development, testing acceptance and production environments. 
#   stages may be rolled into one: e.g. testing and acceptance may be one site, server and codebase.
#  @TODO: write documentation on staging handling: code versus database: both are moved/im-exported differently.
